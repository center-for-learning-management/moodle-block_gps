# moodle-block_gps
Moodle Block Plugin to determine the current user-position

This block works together with the availability condition "gps" and allows a user to determine the current gps location. The location is stored in the current session and is used by the availability condition. Furthermore the block can show the locations in a course by list or on an interactive map.

Attention: your site needs to be run under https to use geolocation!
